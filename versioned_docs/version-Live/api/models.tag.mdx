Endpoints for Causal Decision Models. Models are largely made up of [components](api/components.tag.mdx).

## Roles

Endpoints for CDMs will are relevant for software targeting many common DI roles, some of which are listed below.

- [Decision Model Builders](https://opendi-org.github.io/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Model%20Builder/) may use these endpoints to share models and components that they have authored, to receive model components that they wish to incorporate, etc.
- [Decision Asset Managers](https://opendi-org.github.io/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Asset%20Manager/) may use these endpoints to provide access to curated libraries of CDMs and other DI Assets.
- [Decision Simulation Builders](https://opendi-org.github.io/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Simulation%20Builder/) may use these endpoints to access and analyze CDMs to prepare them for simulation.
