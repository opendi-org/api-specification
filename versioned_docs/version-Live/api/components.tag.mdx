Endpoints for model diagram and runnable model components used in Causal Decision Models. Components include [Diagrams](./retrieve-a-diagram-component) and [Runnable Models](./retrieve-a-runnable-model-component).

## Roles

Endpoints for CDM components are relevant for software targeting many common DI roles, some of which are listed below.

- [Decision Model Builders](http://opendi.org/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Model%20Builder/) may use these endpoints to share model components that they have authored.
- [Decision Asset Managers](http://opendi.org/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Asset%20Manager/) may use these endpoints to provide access to curated libraries of CDM components and other DI Assets.
