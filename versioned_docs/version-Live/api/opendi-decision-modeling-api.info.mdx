This WIP API specification intends to define standard endpoints that OpenDI-compliant systems are expected to provide or utilize.  
This specification's primary goal is to align an ecosystem of vendors, researchers, educators, and other users around a shared interoperability framework.



This API largely concerns [Causal Decision Models](api/models.tag.mdx) and other related data structures used to model, simulate, and visualize decisions.
