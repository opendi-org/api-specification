Endpoints for processors, representing compute resources used for simulating Causal Decision Models.

## Roles

Endpoints for processors are relevant for software targeting simulation-related DI roles, some of which are listed below.

- [Decision Simulation Managers](http://opendi.org/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Simulation%20Manager/) may use these endpoints to manage compute resources in the process of running simulations, to generate [Results](api/results.tag.mdx).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
