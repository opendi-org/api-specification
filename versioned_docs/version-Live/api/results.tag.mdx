Endpoints for simulation results, from simulated Causal Decision Models.

## Roles

Endpoints for simulation results are relevant for software targeting simulation-related DI roles, some of which are listed below.

- [Decision Simulation Managers](http://opendi.org/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Simulation%20Manager/) may use these endpoints to send and receive results from simulations they have previously run on [Processors](api/processors.tag.mdx).
- [Decision Monitors](http://opendi.org/roles-user-stories/Roles/Decision%20Monitor) may use these endpoints in the process of comparing simulation results to ongoing monitored decision models.
