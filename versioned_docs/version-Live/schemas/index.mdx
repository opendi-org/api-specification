# JSON Schemas for OpenDI API

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

The OpenDI API specification relies on a set of [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definitions.  
When used together, these schemas allow developers to represent Causal Decision Models in a common data structure. The [OpenDI API specification](api) uses these schemas in its endpoint definitions.

The pages in this section provide a basic interface for exploring the full Causal Decision Model schema, as well as some examples.
