# OpenDI Standard API Specification

This site houses the WIP drafts for the OpenDI API Specification and related JSON Schemas.

## OpenDI API Specification

The API is specified in [OpenAPI version 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md), in a JSON format.

You can view our API documentation in the OpenDI API category.  
Documentation was generated with [this helpful Docusaurus plugin](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs).

## JSON Schemas

Schemas for the API adhere to the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) standard, using [Draft 07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes).

Schemas define the structure of Causal Decision Models, used in requests and responses throughout the API.  
If you would like to view the full Causal Decision Model schema on its own, we provide separate documentation for the JSON Schema.

You can view the JSON Schema documentation in the Schemas category.
