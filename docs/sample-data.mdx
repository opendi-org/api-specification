# Test Data

The following example data adheres to the current draft of the OpenDI JSON Schema.  
This demonstrates the intended structure of the CDM overall, and provides some examples of valid permutations for internal components.

This is not intended as a working or applied example of a CDM in a realistic context.

You can also view the [raw source file](./api-source/schemas/test-data.json).
