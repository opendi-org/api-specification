# OpenDI Refence Architecture -- API Specification

This site houses the WIP drafts for the upcoming OpenDI API specification and related JSON Schemas.

## OpenDI API Specification

The API is specified in [OpenAPI version 3.0.3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md), in a JSON format.

You can view the documentation for the API in the OpenDI API category.

Documentation generated with [this helpful Docusaurus plugin](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs).

## JSON Schemas

Schemas for the API are defined according to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). Schemas currently use [Draft 07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes).

Schemas are used throughout the API specification, with documentation embedded in each endpoint where relevant.  
If you would like to view the full Causal Decision Model schema on its own, we provide separate documentation for the JSON Schema.

You can view the JSON Schema documentation in the Schemas category.
