## Maintenance

Looking for notes about local deployment for testing, GitHub Actions setup, Pages Deployment, etc.?  
View the [Maintainer Guide, here.](./Maintainer%20Guide/README.md)

# Getting up to speed

A good way to get familiar with the schema is to browse some test data. See `test-data.json`.  
Ideally, clone the repo to a dev environment that has JSON Schema integration, like VS Code. See instructions below.

Alternatively, browse the docs on the OpenDI website.  
These docs pull information directly from the schema and presents it in a more readable format. 

## VS Code

1. Clone the repository to a local folder.
2. Open the repository folder VS Code.
3. In VS Code, open `test-data.json`.
4. Hover over portions of the test data to see popups for the title and description information included in the schema.
5. Try adding to the test data. Use the [Problems Panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_errors-warnings) to see what changes would bring your data into schema compliance (missing/malformed fields, etc).

# Resources Used

The OpenDI JSON Schema definition is based on the Schema specifications managed by [JSON-Schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).
